## Course Description
This course is an introduction to the discipline of computer science, with a focus on the 
design and implementation of algorithms to solve simple problems using a high-level programming 
language. Topics include fundamental programming constructs, problem-solving strategies, 
debugging techniques, declaration models, and an overview of procedural and object-oriented 
programming languages. Students will learn to design, implement, test, and debug algorithms 
using pseudocode and a high-level programming language. Not open to students who have previously 
received credit for COMS B14.

## Student Learning Outcomes
Understand and know how to use fundamental programming constructs 
* Analyze and explain the behavior of simple programs involving the fundamental programming constructs covered by this unit. 
* Modify and expand short programs that use standard conditional and iterative control structures and functions. 
* Design, implement, test, and debug a program that uses each of the following fundamental programming constructs: basic computation, simple I/O, standard conditional and iterative structures, and the definition of functions. 
* Choose appropriate conditional and iteration constructs for a given programming task. 
* Apply the techniques of structured (functional) decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces. 
* Describe the mechanics of parameter passing. 
* Design, implement, test, and debug simple programs in an object-oriented programming language.

Design and implement algorithms to solve problems 
* Discuss the importance of algorithms in the problem-solving process. 
* Identify the necessary properties of good algorithms. 
* Create algorithms for solving simple problems. 
* Use pseudocode or a programming language to implement, test, and debug algorithms for solving simple problems. 
* Describe strategies that are useful in debugging.


Discuss general programming-language ideas 
* Summarize the evolution of programming languages illustrating how this history has led to the paradigms available today. 
* Identify at least one distinguishing characteristic for each of the programming paradigms covered in this unit.

Understand and use variables and types 
* Explain the value of declaration models, especially with respect to programming-in-the-large. 
* Identify and describe the properties of a variable such as its associated address, value, scope, persistence, and size. 
* Discuss type incompatibility. 
* Demonstrate different forms of binding, visibility, scoping, and lifetime management. 
* Defend the importance of types and type-checking in providing abstraction and safety. 
* Design and implement user-defined types, using Object-Oriented principles.

## Accommodations 
Students with disabilities needing accommodation, including those who had an IEP in high school, should make requests to Disabled Students Programs and Services in CSS 10, or Delano room 1001 (661-395-4334, (661-720-2000 Delano)).  All requests for accommodations require appropriate advance notice to avoid a delay in services. Please discuss approved accommodations with me so we can work together to ensure your access and success at BC

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The school policy allows up to 2 weeks of absences before I am required to drop you. If you are tardy, you will be assessed an absences for every 2 tardies. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog. Students must notify me in the event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in the colleges academic calendar under [Important Dates](https://www.bakersfieldcollege.edu/important-dates). It is also expected that students will notify me before class in the rare instance of needing to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, may be marked absent upon their early departure.
