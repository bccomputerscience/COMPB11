## Course Description
This course is an introduction to the discipline of computer science, with a focus on the 
design and implementation of algorithms to solve simple problems using a high-level programming 
language. Topics include fundamental programming constructs, problem-solving strategies, 
debugging techniques, declaration models, and an overview of procedural and object-oriented 
programming languages. Students will learn to design, implement, test, and debug algorithms 
using pseudocode and a high-level programming language. Not open to students who have previously 
received credit for COMS B14.

## Student Learning Outcomes
Understand and know how to use fundamental programming constructs 
* Analyze and explain the behavior of simple programs involving the fundamental programming constructs covered by this unit. 
* Modify and expand short programs that use standard conditional and iterative control structures and functions. 
* Design, implement, test, and debug a program that uses each of the following fundamental programming constructs: basic computation, simple I/O, standard conditional and iterative structures, and the definition of functions. 
* Choose appropriate conditional and iteration constructs for a given programming task. 
* Apply the techniques of structured (functional) decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces. 
* Describe the mechanics of parameter passing. 
* Design, implement, test, and debug simple programs in an object-oriented programming language.

Design and implement algorithms to solve problems 
* Discuss the importance of algorithms in the problem-solving process. 
* Identify the necessary properties of good algorithms. 
* Create algorithms for solving simple problems. 
* Use pseudocode or a programming language to implement, test, and debug algorithms for solving simple problems. 
* Describe strategies that are useful in debugging.


Discuss general programming-language ideas 
* Summarize the evolution of programming languages illustrating how this history has led to the paradigms available today. 
* Identify at least one distinguishing characteristic for each of the programming paradigms covered in this unit.

Understand and use variables and types 
* Explain the value of declaration models, especially with respect to programming-in-the-large. 
* Identify and describe the properties of a variable such as its associated address, value, scope, persistence, and size. 
* Discuss type incompatibility. 
* Demonstrate different forms of binding, visibility, scoping, and lifetime management. 
* Defend the importance of types and type-checking in providing abstraction and safety. 
* Design and implement user-defined types, using Object-Oriented principles.

## Textbook

### Required:
* Java Concepts (Early Objects) (8th edition) by Cay S. Horstmann, ISBN: 9781119056454  
* The Java Tutorial 
    * URL: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/
* BC Email Address   
* Flash Drive

## Accommodations and Special Considerations
Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disabled Student Programs 
& Services at (661) 395-4334, (on-campus located at Student Success Center Building, 1st Floor, Counseling Center), as soon as possible 
to better ensure such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Students who have received an accomodations checklist must bring
me a copy as directed. It is the students responsibility to arrange any alternative testing that is allowed under the accomodations checklist.

## Equity and Inclusion
Bakersfield College is committed to creating and fostering a positive, safe and conducive learning environment based on open communication where diversity, equity, and inclusion are recognized, valued and inform thoughtful decision-making and action. BC embraces individual difference and expects all employees and students to respect these differences and accept an understanding that individuals have unique perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews that may be different from their own.

## Academic Honesty
Each student in this course will abide by the Academic Honesty Policy described in the Academic Information and Standards section of the Bakersfield College Catalog.
Collaboration in class while working on assignments is encouraged. Various projects in class will require group work. Students who do not participate equally with others on assigned group projects will receive a grade of zero.
Please be sensitive to the learning environment and the needs of each and every student in class. Avoid causing distractions or engaging in non-class activity. 

### Actions that will not be tolorated 
* Using any unauthorized material during an exam, quiz, or any time of assignment
* Copying another students work including source code
* Collaborating during an exam
* Buying, stealing, or otherwise obtaining information regarding course's assessment material
* Submitting another peron's work as your own
* Giving your work to another person to fullfill their assignments
* Plagiarizing 

A violation of our academic standards will be immediately reported to the Dead of Student Life plus zero points earned for any assignment involved for each person involved.
No excpetions.

## Digital Devices (Cell phones, Personal Computer Devices)
Cell phones and cell phone usage is a classroom disruption. You know how to use and operate your devices. It is expected that you will turn cells phones off or otherwise silence your devices before class starts and respond only after class ends. If class has not started, please do not
have conversations within class on your device. Carry your conversation outside of the classroom. If there is an an emergency, you should leave the class to answer your calls or messages. Do not send text messages while in class. Again, have your conversations outside of class. This includes any
other social media platform that has messaging capabilities. Do not conduct personal conversations when the instructor is lecturing. Disciplinary action including removal from class will result. Personal computers or other electronic devices should not be used in class for non-class related activities. In classes with Labs or other areas where computers are being used, these systems are provided for classroom activities only. 

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog will be enforced. Students must notify me in the event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in the colleges academic calendar. It is also expected that students will notify me before class in the rare instance of needing to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, will be marked absent upon their early departure.

## General Classroom Etiquette
The intent of the classroom etiquette policy is to outline the need to have considerations for other students within your class. The following guidelines
have been provided to help you understand what this means.

* Digital devices should be silenced, turned off, or otherwise muted. 
* Prepare your desktop/tabletop area before the lecture starts. Prepare to leave once the lecture is concluded. Not before.
  * If you're in a computer lab, get logged in promptly. 
* No eating in the classroom.
  * If you're in a computer lab, do not bring in outside beverages.
* Sleeping is now allowed. If you are tired, please rest outside of the classroom. If you'd like, you can stand up in the back of the class.
  * If you are asleep you will be asked to leave.

## Exams, Assignments, and Late Policy 
Make-up exams, quizzes, or any other type of assignment will not be given. Late assignments will not be accepted. Assignments are due at the beginning of the class session. I will collect
all assignments. I will announce a "last call" for any lingering assignments, after the annoucement is made assignments will not longer be accepted. I will drop your lowest your 
lowest homework assignment and lowest quiz score. You may always arrange to turn in assignments or take exams in advance of the scheduled times. 
Exams and quizzes will be timed. You will not be given extra time to complete the exam or quiz if you start late.
