## COMP B11 Fall 2016 Project
We're going to work on creating a Course Management application for our class project. 

The application could be used by students, faculty, and staff to manage a campuses courses.

We will focus on several features of the product. They will be presented as a set of User Stories.

As a student, I would like to know my grade for a course.
As a professor, I would like to create an assignment.
As a student, I would like to know my class schedule.
As a professor, I would like to assign grades for a class assignment.

This can be a console based or gui based program. Higher points will go toward a well presented 
console based application than a sparsely featured graphical application.

We will define a set of tests that will help us determine the completeness of our appilcation.
This will be done during User Acceptance Testing.
