## Homework 6A

Write a program called homework6A.java

The purpose of this assignment is to declare, call, and define function definitions for a menu 
based program that will mulitpy, divide, and perform the power function on two values that will be input.

```console
  Welcome to the COMP 11 Homework 6-A Menu
  ====================================
  1.  Multiply two integers
  2.  Divide two integers
  3.  Power of base and exponent

  0.  Exit
  ====================================
  Enter selection:
```

From within each case statement, there will be a void function that gets the input from the user 
and stores the input into the referenced variables, and a second function that takes the input as 
parameters, does the task and will return the result. 

### Expected Output

```console
The result of multiplying 4 and 9 is 36
```

 Your output can vary a bit from this.
