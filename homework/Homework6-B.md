## Homework 6-B

Write a program called homework6B.java

The pow standard math method may be used to raise any double to a double. We will write our own 
implementation of this method. If the exponent is integral and non-negative, however, that is a very inefficient way to solve the
problem. Write your own ipow function to raise any double (m) to a non-negative integral power (n) and
return the result. Its prototype should be as follows:

```java
double ipow(double base, int exponent);
```

Do not use log, exp, or pow. Use a loop!
Your program should be identical to 6-A except that it should invoke ipow, instead of Math.pow.
 

### Expected Output

```console
The result of raising 2 to the power of 4 is 16
```
 
 Your output can vary a bit from this.
