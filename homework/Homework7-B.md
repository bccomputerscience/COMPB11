## Homework 7-B

Write a program called homework7B.java

Remember that the pow standard math function may be used to raise any double to a double exponent using
logarithms. If the exponent is integral and non-negative, however, that is a very inefficient way to solve the
problem. Write your own ipow function to raise any double (m) to a non-negative integral power (n) and
return the result. Its prototype should be as follows:
double ipow(double m, int n);
Do not use log, exp, or pow. Use a loop!
Your mainline (CH5-A.C) should be identical to CH3-B except that it should invoke ipow, instead of pow.
