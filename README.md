## Course Description
This course is an introduction to the discipline of computer science, with a focus on the 
design and implementation of algorithms to solve simple problems using a high-level programming 
language. Topics include fundamental programming constructs, problem-solving strategies, 
debugging techniques, declaration models, and an overview of procedural and object-oriented 
programming languages. Students will learn to design, implement, test, and debug algorithms 
using pseudocode and a high-level programming language. Not open to students who have previously 
received credit for COMS B14.
